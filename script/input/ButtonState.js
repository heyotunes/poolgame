/**This code creates a simple object called `ButtonState`, which is used to track the state of a button in the game. It has two properties: `down` and `pressed`. `down` tells if the button is being held down, and `pressed` checks if the button was pressed at that moment. In the pool game, this might be used to track when players press keys or click the mouse to control things like aiming or shooting the cue ball. It helps the game know when the player is interacting with the controls. */
