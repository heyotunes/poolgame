/*This code creates a "Player" in a pool game and keeps track of their scores. It has two important numbers: the score for the current game (called `matchScore`) and the overall score across multiple games (called `totalScore`). The `color` property is used to represent the type of balls (like red or yellow) the player is playing with, but it starts as "undefined" until set later. This is like assigning each player their color and keeping track of how well they're doing during the game and across multiple games. It's a way to know who's winning in a pool match.*/
