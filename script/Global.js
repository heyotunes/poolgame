/**This code sets up some basic rules and settings for a pool game. It defines the size of the balls, the border around the table, and the size of the holes where the balls can fall in. It also controls whether certain features are turned on or off, like if the game displays on the screen, if sound effects are playing, or if the game is paused. There are also settings for keyboard controls and how many training rounds the computer should run. Lastly, it enables an AI player and lets you choose which player the AI is. */
